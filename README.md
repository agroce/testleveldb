Differential fuzzing for leveldb and rocksdb.

One way to go about things right now (until background threads in
rocksdb are handled) is to use AFL, fuzz leveldb, then run the tests
on the two databases together.  This is pretty simple, just


1.  install [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate).  The easiest way to do this is probably the [DeepState docker](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate#DOCKER).

2.  build both databases using afl-clang as your compiler, to get
    instrumentation (in fact, for now, you can skip this for RocksDB,
    just build it)

3. build the fuzzers, and fuzz leveldb like, e.g., this:

```
~/afl/afl-fuzz -i <sometest> -o <output_dir> -- ./TestLevelDB --input_test_file @@ --exit_on_fail
```

You can also go for libFuzzer based testing:

1.  install [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate) with BUILD_LIBFUZZER=TRUE

2.  install leveldb, after editing its CMakeLists.txt to add -fsanitize=integer,undefined,address,fuzzer-no-link

editing the CMakeLists.txt thus:

 may work

Make sure to use a clang >= 6.0 to compile!

-fsanitize=integer,undefined,address,fuzzer-no-link:

Make sure to use a clang >= 6.0 to compile!

4.  edit this repo's Makefile to link to `deepstate_LF` or `deepstate_AFL` to build libfuzzer/afl fuzzers.

Using a ramdisk for the databases is *STRONGLY* recommended, unless
you want to both fuzz slowly and burn out your SSD.

5.  `make`

`DiffTestDBs` and `DiffTestDBs_LF` are the primary fuzzers.  `TestLevelDB`
just runs leveldb, without differential testing with RocksDB.  Tests from `TestLevelDB` run in `DiffTestDBs`.  If you have trouble building the databases with instrumentation, in fact, you can just build them exactly as you normally would for release, and then use Eclipser to fuzz TestLevelDB.  Unfortunately, some issue currently prevents Eclipser from fuzzing rocksdb.
